# Dart IndexOutOfBoundsException
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `RangeError` exception that occurs when you try to access an element in a list using an index that is outside the valid range of indices.

## Bug
The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element of a list using an index that is out of bounds. This results in a `RangeError` exception.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code that handles potential index out-of-bounds errors by using appropriate checks to prevent the exception.
